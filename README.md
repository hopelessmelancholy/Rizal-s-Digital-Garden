# Rizal's Digital Garden

Rizal's Digital Garden is a pseudo-online knowledge base about the national hero Rizal. It makes use of the app Obsidian and Github to ensure that the files remain accesible for many types of people and retain a certain permeance through proper version controls. The project aims to create an interactive, ever-growing, and aesthetic information repository about Rizal, directing the newer generation to a reliable and free resource on the FIlipino National Hero.

This repository contains only a few files at the start, because the project is a community-driven one. Therefore, Filipinos and scholars around the world are expected to contribute to the discussion by adding their takes on certain aspects of Rizal and his works. Due to the atomic nature of the notes in this repository, adding conflicting views on Rizal is not necessarily bad as they are separate in the knowledge graph and may be linked to differing concepts.

## Rationale 
The nationalism and patriotism that Jose Rizal possesses are essential to be recognized by people in order to instill the same values among the Filipino youth. We believe there is a need to formally introduce our hero yet can have an interactive approach with the youth of the same generation as us towards understanding the life of our national hero, Jose Rizal.

Jose Rizal is widely known for his literary works, the Noli me Tangere and El
Filibusterismo. Even though his literary works had been published for a long time, the beliefs and values of nationalism and patriotism he showed can still be felt by readers of whatever generation.

So for the concept paper, we believe that his work, notably the El Filibusterismo and Noli me Tangere, should continue to inspire and instill a sense of nationalism and patriotism in the minds of the youth, particularly the students. Through the use of cyberspace which most of the youth are familiar with, creating a digital garden that contains personal takes of students on the works of Rizal or his legacy to continue to challenge the students on how they were inspired by Rizal or how they see Rizal.

## Contributing
As a community driven project, this repository contains the main files necessary to get started with the digital garden. It is incomplete as it assumes that Rizal's effects on the country can never be completed and that changes will happen constantly. In order to contribute, it is reccomendded to join our community channels to ask for tecnical help in publishing your contributions. Furthermore, this project places strict importance in making a interconnected graph. Therefore, all contributions must be connected to atleast one previous contribution.
